[{"content":"The metalFunk 3D Printer\rWhen a one year project is solved years in the furture\nThe Evolution of metalFunk\rThe metalFunk 3D printer has undergone several name changes since its inception. It started as A3D-One when I was 16, reflecting my early ambition and enthusiasm. Later, it became MetalHunk due to its robust, full-metal frame—its most impressive feature. Now, it’s called MetalFunk, a nod to the challenges and quirks that have come with building it, while also embracing a funky, more light-hearted spirit.\nThe Begining\rDesigning this 3D printer has been an enlightening experience, though not without its frustrations. What began as a teenage project has turned into a long-term endeavor, teaching me valuable lessons in engineering and perseverance. Here’s a look at what this journey has entailed:\nInvestment: Approximately $400 initially, plus an additional $100 for modifications and troubleshooting. Challenges: Numerous, including complex technical issues and the learning curve of working with limited knowledge. Unique Goal: To create a 3D printer that no one else in the world has—a unique testament to my dedication and creativity. Key Specs and Features\rFrame: Built entirely from 2040 and 2020 T-Slot aluminum extrusion profiles, making it incredibly sturdy. Extruders: Includes a BMG Bowden extruder and a custom slim extruder for the Ender/CR Hotend. Electronics: Currently runs on the classic Ramps 1.4 with an Arduino Mega, with plans to upgrade to either the Ender 3 - 4.2.7 Non-Silent Board or the BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V3.0. Firmware: Utilizes Marlin 2.0.1, featuring a double Z-axis for enhanced stability. Future Improvements: Plans to incorporate V-Roller based kinematics and other modern features. Current Status (As of March 2024)\rFrame: Solid and usable. Movement: Operational, though previously it wasn’t. Safety: No longer prone to catching fire, a significant improvement. Print Quality: Currently subpar, with major issues including layer skipping and motor overheating. Development Challenges\rLayer Skipping: The printer struggles with layer skipping on prints longer than 40 minutes, rendering them unusable. Motor Currents: The Nema 17 motors (17HS3401) overheat at their rated 1.2 amps, requiring careful current management. Uploaded CAD File\rThe CAD file includes the metal frame and motors/endstops. All plastic components need to be redesigned from scratch.\nGoals and To-Do List\rRedesign and Reprint Plastic Parts: Every piece of 3D printed material needs to be updated from the Frankenstein adaptation I initially created. Upgrade the Control Board: Replace the outdated Ramps 1.4 with a more reliable and modern board. Achieve Reliable Printing: With a new board and redesigned parts, consistent and reliable printing should be attainable. Enhance the Extruder: Improve aesthetics, add a cooling fan, lighting, and better cable management. Improve Aesthetics: Give the printer a more polished and professional look, infusing it with personality. Incorporate V-Roller Kinematics: Update the motion system to modern standards, eliminating the use of smooth rods and linear bearings. Future Innovations: Aim for high speeds, quiet operation, wireless connectivity, and other advanced features. Timeline and Future Outlook\rI aim to achieve at least objective #4 by Summer 2024. However, as a busy Electronics Engineering and Computer Science student, I’m not imposing a strict deadline. If by August 2024, the printer isn’t reliably printing, I may consider scrapping the project due to unsustainable value.\nMan Hours Logged\r2019-2020: 50+ hours Dec 2023 - Jan 2024: 20+ hours March 2024 (Holy Week): 10+ hours Total: ~80+ hours Stay tuned for more updates on the metalFu(n)k 3D printer as I continue to refine and improve this unique creation.\n","date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/metal-hunk-3d-printer/","title":"Metal Hunk 3D Printer"}]
